Assuming you already followed the compilation/VS setup instructions on the course website, you would only need to do the following within Visual Studio,

1) Open the solution provided in the folder
2) If the following files from the folder are not already in the header and source file sections, add them:
Source Files: InitShader.cpp, rotate-sphere-texture.cpp to Source Files
Header Files: Angel-yjc.h, CheckError.h, mat-yjc-new.h, vec.h

3) Run the code within rotate-sphere-texture.cpp with or without debugging.

For reference, it will prompt you for the name of a text file containing the appropriate triangle mesh vertices for a sphere, the project contains the following .txt files included:

- sphere.8.txt
- sphere.128.txt
- sphere.256.txt
- sphere.1024.txt

Enter one of them as a string input to execute the program.

The above also assumes you have set up the appropriate paths for your Include and Library directories on Visual Studio with respect to OpenGL.
